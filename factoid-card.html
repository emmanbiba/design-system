                <h4 class="factoids">Grass-fed &amp; Grain-finished</h4>
                <p>Our cattle are pasture raised where they are fed grass most of their lives and then finished on a mixture of grass & recycled distillery grain. We work with our partner farms & ranches to take care of the cattle throughout the process to minimize stress, raise quality of life, and create a sustainable process that produces America’s best beef.</p>

                <h4 class="factoids">Born, Raised &amp; Made in America</h4>
                <p>Because over 85% of grass-fed beef is imported from overseas. This hurts the quality of meat you eat and the quality of life for American farmers. Buying from independent farmers in the US lets you Do Good & Eat Good at the same time.</p>

                <h4 class="factoids">USDA Prime &amp; Upper Choice</h4>
                <p>Every cut of beef we sell is USDA Graded Prime or Upper Choice, which are the highest two grades beef can receive in America. They are hand cut, hand trimmed, and aged 21 days to reach the optimal tenderness and richest flavor possible.</p>
